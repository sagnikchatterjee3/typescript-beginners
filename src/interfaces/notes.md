- When we create objects , we are not sure that the objects are creted consistenly across the huge application that we develop.
- One developer , might not even these fields and to prevent them from happening , we can use an interface.

- Interface defines all the rules that an object , an class, and function should follow.

- In the interface we can define fileds and properties that an function or class that subscribes to that should implement.


- Interface acts like a contract in Typescript. Not like an inheritance , contract that our objects can follow and its only compile time.

- Can defined interfaces for functions, arrays and classes.
