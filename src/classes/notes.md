- classes are blueprints for objects.
- along with the set of rules, it provides the implementation, the constructor , the accessor methods and much more.
- Classes are run time ; unlike interface which are compile time thing.
- They are blue print / template for our object.

- constructor is a function with which we can define the object properties right when it is defined.
